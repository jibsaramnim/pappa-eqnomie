<p>Many people seek happiness in workshops, books or meditation. Nothing wrong 
with that. But it does show that people do not feel good automatically. Our 
economical thinking has caused that in our daily life our hearts and souls are 
left at a lower level of attention then money or possession. The economy asks 
for more usage, more buying and more profit. This economical thinking in terms 
of 'more' also applies for less obvious matters; politics asks for more votes, 
religion for more worshippers en education for more knowledge. Care-institutions 
ask for more money, nature for more space, and people... Well, people... Where 
does this leave people in all of this..?</p>
<p>Organization Adviser Jansen and Communication Adviser Hakkert state that the 
economy should start acting differently in order to remain successful in the 
future. A development in the thinking of people is already going on. They work 
and live more and more from the mindset that from their heart and soul comes the 
core of their existence. They want to express that emotion, their passion, not 
just in their leisure time but also in their work.<br>
<br>
Jansen: &quot;All human action is rooted in emotion. Emotion means: movement by 
acting from your feelings, your soul. This is something so deeply human, that 
one can not discard it. One who does, gets into problems and does not feel 
well.&quot; Hakkert: &quot;Our lives have become very practical. Everything needs to be 
fast and efficient. The clock has become a stopwatch and time something that 
rushes by. In this hectic world a person rarely feels truly alive. Therefore the 
soul seeks 'a way out'.&quot;</p>
<p>Jansen and Hakkert have put a manifest on the internet: <b>
<a href="http://www.eqnomie.nl/index.php?page=home&lang=eng">The EQnomy 
Manifesto</a></b>. In it they show that it could be different, and that there 
are people putting life, and experiencing life, above everything else. In only 
12 theses they show that a new economy has developed. An EQnomy that puts people 
and their needs first and that will provide for a society that makes people 
happy. There is an opportunity to sign the Manifesto and also to read all 
previous signings. This alone makes it a fun initiative. This way you can see 
how others think about more happiness in work and in private by just being your 
authentic self. Go to: <a href="http://www.eqnomie.nl">www.eqnomie.nl</a>
