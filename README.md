# The EQnomy Manifesto (EQnomie.nl) archive

I think my late father and I both had forgotten about this website, which thanks to my first job's efforts had remained online all these years. This archive contains the raw files. The site had stopped working correctly seemingly quite a long time ago, with the "read signatures" page not showing anything, and I don't think submitting a signatures was working quite right or at all either.

I have chosen not to renew the accompanying domain as the project had ended quite a long time ago already, and I'd rather keep his more recent website alive, it feels closer to his more recent works. Regardless, I'm glad this was uncovered so I can save the files here alongside his other projects.
